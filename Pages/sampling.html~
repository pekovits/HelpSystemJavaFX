<h2> Sampling methods</h2>
<p>
	The sampling methods help to choose the appropriate method to sample the observations we want to condition on.

<ul>
	<li>Uniform</li>
	<li>Density dependent</li>
	<li>
	Latin hypercube sampling.A method of choosing random samples from prior distributions of multiple
	variables. Correlation or co-variation between the variables can be taken into
	account. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Monte carlo Markov chain. A method of numerically integrating a probability or likelihood surface by
iterative random sampling aimed at achieving a sample density dependent
on the local probability or likelihood. Once convergence of the chain has
been reached, each sample can be treated as having equal likelihood.
