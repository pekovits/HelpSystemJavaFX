   Forward Uncertainty Analysis is an assessment of uncertainty that depends only on the numerical
propagation of prior assumptions about the nature of different sources of
uncertainty and their interactions. A modeller needs to decide on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Independent</li>
  <li>Correlated (in space or time)</li>
  <li>Covarying with other factors </li>
</ul>
