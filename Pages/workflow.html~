<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>
	The workflow represents all the stages that a modeller might choose to follow through his analysis.Suggested workflow features are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Model Structure</li>
  <li>Model Emulator if it's needed</li>
  <li>Boundary Condition. Constraints and values of variables required to run a model for a particular
	flow domain and time period. May include input variables such as rainfalls and
	temperatures or constraints such as specifying a fixed head or specified flux rate.</li>
  <li>Pathway Parameters</li>
  <li>Receptor/Consequence model</li>
  <li>Joint Hazards</li>
  <li>Model Validation / Conditioning Data</li>
</ul>  

<p>We follow the source-pathway-receptor framework but a modeller might choose to construct his own workflow.</p>
