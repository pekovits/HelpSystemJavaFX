   Conditioning uncertainty on data is the process of refining a model structure, or a distribution of parameter
   values of a model structure as more data become available. A modeller needs to decide on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sampling methods</li>
  <li>Evaluation methods</li>
  <li>If possible gives some context on your choices or assumptions you made for these choices.</li>
</ul>
