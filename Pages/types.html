<h2>Types of uncertainty</h2>
<p>
	Types of uncertainties can classify as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Aleatory Uncertainty. Often used in contrast to epistemic uncertainty. Use this if you want to treat source of uncertainty as a probability    	distribution or probability function. This might include a model discrepancy function in validation/conditioning.
  </li>
  <li>
     Epistemic uncertainties treated as probabilities. How the response of a system varies in ways that cannot be simply
     described by random stochastic variation. Often used in contrast to aleatory
     uncertainty.You are happy to treat source of uncertainty as a probability distribution or fuzzy measure. This might include the 	     	      representation of input uncertainties or outcomes of an expert elicitation exercise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Epistemic uncertainties treated as scenarios. You cannot associate probabilities to possible uncertainties, so need to specify a range of scenarios.   This might be different forms of probabilistic representations (e.g. scenarios of different distributions with different tail behaviours).   It might be different potential futures (e.g. potential climates or anthropogenic modifications).    Scenarios might be defined on the basis of an expert elicitation.
  </li>
</ul>  
<p>We suggest to think properly how you are going to treat a source of uncertainty you might encounter in your application and then fill them in the system.</p>
