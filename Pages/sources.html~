<h2>Sources of uncertainty</h2>
<p>
	The sources of uncertainty vary from application to application and from workflow feature to workflow feature. For example, for the application of uncertainty in flood inundation maps for the Boundary Conditions workflow feature we can have the following sources of uncertainty:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upstream discharge</li>
  <li>Design event magnitude</li>
  <li>Flood defences</li>
</ul>  
<p>We suggest to think properly the sources of uncertainty you might encounter in your application and then fill them in the system.</p>
